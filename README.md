# Kafkanet
.Net implementation of the Apache Kafka Protocol that provides basic functionality through Producer/Consumer classes. The project also offers balanced consumer implementation. 
The project is a fork from ExactTarget's Kafka-net Client, tuned to serve Microsoft's Big Data needs. At Microsoft we run Kafka on multiple Windows Clusters with JBOD machines.
